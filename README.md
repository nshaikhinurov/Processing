# Generative art made with Processing

## Description
Using programming and different algorithms I create these beautiful abstract artworks and landscapes. Adding some randomness or using Perlin noise function gives me the ability to express my inspiration. Also this project is a good coding practice.

More about Processing on [Processing.org](https://processing.org/)

All the artworks are available as canvas prints. So you can support the project!
